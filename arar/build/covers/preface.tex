The word \textit{Zahrat Alearear} translates to $Juniper \ Flower$. The Juniper tree is likely best known for swirling trunks, dense bush-like branches, meaty and spined leaves, and its fragrance. It has often been used in the concoction of liquors and perfumes, as well as serving a ceremonial purification purpose when burned. However, it is also the bearer of small flowers with starkly pointed petals.

\leftskip0.25in
\pmb{Bass Flute} : Some dynamic marks are louder than the instrument can achieve in a given register. The desired resultant sound is an airy, overblown tone.

\pmb{Guitar} : At times, strings are required to be retuned as part of a glissando. These strings should remain detuned as a scordatura for the remainder of the piece. A variety of tremolo types are required: \circled{1} a normal tremolo abbreviated as ``norm.'', \circled{2} a tamburo tremolo where the strings are struck rather than plucked abbreviated as ``tamb.'', \circled{3} a rasgueado tremolo using any number of fingers abbreviated as ``ras.'', and \circled{4} a bisbigliando tremolo similar to that of the harp where the strings are to be individually plucked in any random order abbreviated as ``bis.''.

\pmb{Time Signatures} : Some passages make use of unusual time signatures with a denominator which is not a power of 2. Just as a metric change from $\frac{4}{4}$ to $\frac{6}{8}$ should not change the prolation of the contained notes, neither should these unusual time signatures. A signature of $\frac{5}{6}$ represents a measure which lasts for the duration of five triplet quarter notes, relative to the established metronome mark. Prolations within these unusual measures are notated with the standard tuplet brackets.

\pmb{Miscellaneous} : \circled{1} Tremoli should be performed as fast as possible and not as a measured subdivision of the duration to which they are attached. \circled{2} Accidentals apply only to the pitch which they immediately precede, but persist through ties, as such, natural signs do not appear. \circled{3} At times throughout the piece, a ``flat glissando'' notation is used between notes of the same pitch. This is done to show the rhythmic locations of dynamic events.
